Automated security decision-making under uncertainty.

## üè∞ What is Bulwark?

Bulwark is a fast, modern, open-source web application firewall (WAF) and API security gateway. It simplifies the
implementation of detective security controls while offering comprehensive visibility into your web services. Bulwark's
detection-as-code approach to rule definition offers security teams higher confidence in their response to persistent
and adaptive threats. Bulwark plugins offer a wide range of capabilities, enabling security teams to define and evolve
detections rapidly, without making changes to the underlying application.

- **Open Source.** Freely available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license. We're committed to keeping it that way.
- **Extensible.** Define custom detection logic using the SDK, or customize reusable parameterized detections to
    your needs, without writing code.
- **Observable.** Gain comprehensive visibility into both your traffic and the operation of your detections with built-in
    observability features. Enrich your traffic data for improved context.
- **Flexible.** Bulwark's plugin API enables detections to interact with Redis state and other services, including
    machine learning models. Plugins can perform their detections collaboratively using Bulwark's ensemble decisions.
    Securely decrypt session cookies to operate on application-level information.
- **Testable.** Detections can have automated tests. Prevent misclassifications from making it to production.
- **Accurate.** Bulwark has built-in mechanisms to help tune detections for high accuracy, minimize false
    positives, and quickly remediate accuracy issues if they occur. Meet compliance requirements for detective controls
    while avoiding false positives that would disrupt operations.
- **Sandboxed.** Every detection runs inside a secure [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) sandbox, isolating
    detection logic, and ensuring that access never exceeds its permissions grants.
- **Safe.** Deploy in observe-only mode and build confidence in the system before enabling request blocking.
- **Supported.** Bulwark is actively developed and supported by
    [Bob Aman](https://github.com/sporkmonger). There is a freely available
    [community ruleset](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark-community-ruleset) which anyone is welcome
    to contribute to.

## üïµÔ∏è Use Cases

- **Account Takeover:** Detect patterns of abuse like credential stuffing, password spraying, session hijacking,
    and phishing that target account login pages, authentication APIs, or make use of stolen cookies. Reduce time
    spent responding to these threats.
- **Site Scraping:** Identify and block bots that are ignoring `robots.txt` or scraping site data at abnormal
    frequencies, without negatively affecting well-behaved bots and crawlers. This is especially relevant for
    users that may be concerned about their sites being incorporated into training data without authorization.
- **Free-Tier Abuse:** Prevent abusive free-tier usage from making such offerings unsustainable. Send the results
    of runtime detective controls to a Bulwark plugin, where it can be combined with CAPTCHAs and other signals
    to help identify these behaviors earlier, before they consume limited resources.
- **Combine Fraud Signals:** Take advantage of Bulwark's ability to access external services to
    seamlessly combine fraud scoring from independent vendors. Protect interior services from high-volume
    automated fraud like card testing that may otherwise affect availability.
- **Block Exploits:** Bulwark can be used as a WAF to detect and block exploits targeting XSS, SQL injection, and
    other common vulnerabilities.

## üíª Installation

1. [Install the Rust toolchain via rustup.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install the `wasm32-wasi` target needed to build plugins: `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`
3. Install Bulwark: `cargo install bulwark-cli`

## üöÄ Quickstart

In a Bulwark deployment, there are several pieces working together. In the current version of Bulwark,
[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) handles the initial HTTP request processing. Bulwark uses Envoy's
[external processing API][ext-proc] to hook that processing and perform security decision-making on the traffic.
In most configurations, there will be an interior service that handles the actual business logic of the
web application and Envoy will be configured to send the traffic onwards once Bulwark has made its decision.
It's recommended to use Bulwark alongside a [Redis server](https://redis.io/) to maintain state across
multiple Bulwark instances, although this is not strictly necessary if Bulwark is only used with stateless detection
plugins.

[ext-proc]: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_proc/v3/ext_proc.proto

An example [Envoy configuration file](/crates/ext-processor/examples/envoy.yaml) is provided as a starting point
for the typical deployment setup just described. The Envoy server would be launched with the following command:

```bash
envoy -c envoy.yaml
```

Bulwark's own [configuration file](https://bulwark.security/docs/reference/configuration/) is a TOML file that defines
which detection plugins should be used to process a request, as well as details like the listening port and the address
for the Redis server. The listening port in Bulwark's configuration must match the port number given for the
corresponding external processing filter section in Envoy's configuration. Bulwark is launched with the following
command:

```bash
bulwark-cli ext-processor -c bulwark.toml
```

Bulwark plugins are compiled to WebAssembly before use. While it's recommended to do this using a workflow like
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), you can also do this manually, particularly for development.
To compile a Bulwark plugin:

```bash
bulwark-cli build -p rules/example-plugin -o dist/plugins/
```

## üí™ Contributing

Check out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark/issues). We actively maintain a
list of [issues suitable for new contributors][good-first-issue] to the project. Alternatively, detection plugins
may be contributed to the [community ruleset](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark-community-ruleset).

We do not require contributors to sign a license agreement (CLA) because we want users of Bulwark to be confident
that the software will remain available under its current license.
